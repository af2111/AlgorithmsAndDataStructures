### Algorithms

#### [isprime.rb](https://github.com/af2111/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/ruby/isprime.rb)(Ruby)
Ruby version ruby 3.0.0p0 (2020-12-25 revision 95aff21468) (x64-mingw32)

This Ruby script takes a single integer as an argument and checks if it is a prime.
It checks if the modulo of many divisions(loop) is equal to zero, if true,
it returns false as the number is divisible and therefore not a prime.
If the modulo is never zero, it will return true as the number is not divisible
by anthing but itself or one and is therefore not a prime.

The code is partly based of this logic:
